<h1>Welcome to our Hangman game!!</h1>
<p style="font-family:elan">
	The rules is very simple:
</p>
<ul style="font-size:20px">
	<li> We will give you a word and you will try to guess what it is.</li></br>
	<li> At first, you should try to guess by letter, one by one (or you can guess the word immediately if you wanna go big LOL).</li></br>
	<li> If you guess the word or a letter wrong, we will draw a part of the stickman on the hang.</li></br>
	<li> If you manage to guess the word correctly before we draw a full stickman, you win.</li></br>
	<li> If at some point, we have drawn the full stickman, but you still can't find the word, you lose.</li></br>
	<p>Are you ready to start the game? I hope you do. Good luck :))</p></br>
